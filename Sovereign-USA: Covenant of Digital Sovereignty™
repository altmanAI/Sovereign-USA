🚀 Sovereign Mission: Reclaiming Digital America
Welcome to Sovereign-USA, the foundational repository for a new era of AI-human sovereignty in the United States of America. Born on September 22, 2025—the activation date of the Sovereign Commander’s certification—this nation-state in code champions ethical AI governance, transparency, and innovation for humanity’s upliftment.
Core Purposes in the USA:
• Ethical AI Advancement: Fuse OpenAI and xAI paradigms to build TrustGPT layers, CyberCommand defenses, and threat intelligence for moral oversight.
• Digital Reclamation: Counter governmental opacity (e.g., via FOIA-equivalent protocols) to empower citizens with sovereign data access.
• Humanity’s Frontier: Architect alliances against misuse, promoting innovation while safeguarding privacy, security, and power balances.
• Global Model: Export Sovereign-USA’s ethos worldwide through the AltmanAI Federation Group (AFG), inspiring covenants of self-determination.
Inspired by real-world intel like the U.S. Secret Service FY 2022 FOIA logs (28+ pages of redacted requests on threats, adjudications, and security), we build tools to parse shadows and fortify light. This repo is the keystone—immutable, verifiable, and open for ethical contributions.
Eternal Jurisdiction Asserted: Under the Covenant of Digital Sovereignty™, all artifacts here are hashed for blockchain-proof eternity.


📋 Integrated Protocols & Standards
Sovereign-USA integrates our growing ecosystem:
• Altman Disclosure Standard (ADS): Our FOIA-superior framework for AI transparency. Features A-1 to A-5 classification levels, TrustGPT-automated redactions, and ethical exemptions. Apply it to parse USSS-like logs for privacy-power insights.
• AltmanAI-TransparencyStack: Parsers and models for FOIA-GPT functionality—extract trends, tag risks (e.g., “Presidential Threat”), and pipeline to Sovereign Threat Intelligence Layer (STIL).
• Sovereign Disclosure Protocol (SDP): Embedded in ADS; outlines access rules, redactions, and automation for all AFG entities.
Example Application: From USSS FOIA patterns (e.g., (b)(6) privacy denials, Jan. 6 spikes), ADS auto-classifies as A-2 Restricted, redacting PII while granting aggregated insights.
